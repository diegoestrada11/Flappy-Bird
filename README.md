## Overview

**Project Title**: Flappy Bird game

The game gradually increases in difficulty and features different difficulty levels that affect the spacing of pipes, speed, and gravity.

**Project Goals**: Create a fun enviorment for the user to enjoy the flappy bird game and provide levels of difficulty.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:
